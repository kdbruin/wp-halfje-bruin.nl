Description: Hyde is a brazen two-column theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based the Hyde theme for Jekyll and ported to Wordpress. I tries to be a 1-on-1 as most as possible. I tried to keep the html & css for the original Hyde theme and this Wordpress port mostly the same.
